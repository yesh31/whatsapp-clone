## About The App
A simplified, static clone of the WhatsApp web application, built using React.js and CSS. This project replicates the layout and appearance of the WhatsApp web interface, including the chat list, chat interface, and sidebar sections.

## Technologies
I used `react.js`, `css`, `html` for this project.

## Setup
- download or clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yesh31/whatsapp-clone.git
  ```
- cd `whatsapp-clone`
- Install the dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

## Approach
I started out by analysing web.whatsapp.com and understood the layout of the application. Then I divided the entire application into 3 parts for easier development,
- Chat.jsx: deals with all the code
- HomePage.jsx: puts all the components (Chat.jsx, Sidebar.jsx together)

## Status
[name of project] is still in progress. `Version 2` will be out soon.

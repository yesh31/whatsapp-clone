## About The App
This project uses React.js and CSS to create a mock WhatsApp web interface, displaying a range of sample chats with basic interaction features such as selecting a chat and viewing its messages. The goal of this project is to mimic the visual layout of WhatsAppâ€™s interface and practice building structured web layouts with responsive elements.

## Technologies
I used `react.js`, `css`, `html` for this project.

## Setup
- download or clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yesh31/whatsapp-clone.git
  ```
  
- Navigate to the project directory:
  ``` cd whatsapp-clone ```
  
- Install the dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
  
- Run the project:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

## Approach
I started out by analysing web.whatsapp.com and understood the layout of the application. Then I divided the entire application into 3 parts for easier development,
- Chat.jsx: deals with all the code for the conversation panel and the chat previews.
- Sidebar.jsx: deals with the left most corner of the application where you can find all the icons like chat, status, settings, profile etc.
- HomePage.jsx: puts all the components (Chat.jsx, Sidebar.jsx) together to render at one place.

## Future Work
- To make this project responsive to the screen sizes using Bootstrap.
- To add additional functionalities like enabling search box to filter out messages, post and update the conversation panel using axios library.

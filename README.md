## About The App
This project uses React.js and CSS to create a mock WhatsApp web interface, displaying a range of sample chats with basic interaction features such as selecting a chat and viewing its messages. The goal of this project is to mimic the visual layout of WhatsAppâ€™s interface and practice building structured web layouts with responsive elements.

## Technologies
I used `react.js`, `css`, `html` for this project.

- Install the dependencies:

  ```
  
- ```bash

  ```

## Approach
I started out by analysing web.whatsapp.com and understood the layout of the application. Then I divided the entire application into 3 parts for easier development,
- Chat.jsx: deals with all the code from the
- HomePage.jsx: puts all the components (Chat.jsx, Sidebar.jsx together)
